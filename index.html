                January 2021. <b>Gamestop</b>, the American video game company that saw
                its shares rising up <b>from $20 to $400</b> in less than two weeks. The dynamic has probably fed on the rise of risk appetite
                and pandemic boredom, in coincidence with a growing share of younger investors accessing stock trading opportunities
                through low cost trading platforms on investing apps. Gamestop became overpriced due to the online coordination of <b>retail investors</b>,
                started on a subReddit community called <b>Wall Street Bets (WSB)</b>.

              Although many researchers and

              media dynamics around memestocks are broader than we thought.

                      At the beginning of 2021, the stocks of GME looked like a terrible buy.
                      For about a decade, in fact, the Game stop business had deteriorated. Millennials were abandoning the habit of
                      buying video games, preferring to play streaming or downloading.
                      Restrictions due to the <b>Covid-19 pandemic</b> dealt another blow to Gamestop's business, by forcing stores to close.
                      Wall Street hedge funds seized the opportunity and began shorting these stocks, betting to make money if Gamestop's value fell.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0">
                    <p>
                      However, in less than two weeks, the shares of the struggling company rose from just $20 to almost $500 (more than 2.000%).
                      In a matter of days Gamestop became the first case of a "meme stock" that is, <b>
                      a company whose shares became overpriced due to the
                      attention of social media and coordinated action of retail investors
                      </b>. This dynamic was not backed by good performance of its underlying
                      business.
                    </p>
                     <p class="fst-italic">
                       After Gamestop, other companies, such as the AMC movie theatre chain, also enjoyed rapid and seemingly unwarranted increases in their stock prices.

              The impact of retail investors has originated on <b>Reddit</b>, a network of communities where people
			        can participate in different groups – the subreddits – each one discussing a particular interest,
			        hobby or passion. Since the GameStop short squeeze, Reddit became renowned as an arena for self-organised
			        social media-driven investment behaviours. Fueled by members of the Reddit community, these investors decided
			        to flip the switch on large hedge funds that were shorting certain businesses, businesses that had a certain affective
			        value to the people, they claimed. As more retail investors joined in, the result was an <b>acceleration of shares’ price</b>,
			        a short squeeze —  as short sellers bailout to cut their losses. Notwithstanding the popularity of this version of the story,
			        the experts we interviewed also advanced the hypothesis that the whole Gamestop event may have been manipulated by the expert
			        of financial markets, and analyst, hiding behind the influencer name of ‘DeepFuckingValue’.<br>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0">
            <p>
              AMC and GameStop were two prevalent names that caught fire on reddit, inciting an unprecedented number of newbie traders to invest.
			        After them, other companies also enjoyed web popularity and consequent investment behaviours.
			        But <strong>going viral has not led all stocks to a Gamestop-like effect.</strong> Why? That is where we step in.<br>
              As communities proliferated around the most disparate topics, many subreddits dedicated to
              the financial market have popped-up. These communities work as incubators of online “hype” associated with stock prices.
              WallStreetBets is the most popular among them. With more than 12.000.000 subscribers, WSB is one
              of the 55 biggest communities, overall.
            </p>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              As stocks gain visibility on Reddit,
              they are mentioned across different subreddits. The majority of popular stocks on
              Reddit mark their presence on four other communities, beyond WSB.

            <p>
              Soon enough, this “movement” had spillovers beyond the Reddit forum.
              In the Gamestop case, the very same day Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, retweeted
              a link to the r/wallstreetbets trading increased and the stock rose nearly
              140 percent, in after-hours trading. Regarding GameStop and AMC theatre shares,
              the Central Bank of America specifically noted that the volume and volatility of
              those stocks might be related to high activity on Twitter.<br>
              Online activity of WSB users’ is also related with the activity on more
              traditional media outlets, such as newspapers. Cross-referencing data from
              Reddit mentions and data from news articles across the world, we found that
              <b>the increased activity on the subreddit, measured in daily frequency of the stocks’
              mentions, is positively correlated with the volume of press articles mentioning the company</b>.
              <br>
              On days when a stock reaches maximum daily mentions on Wall Street Bets, the press does not reflect
              social media positivity, though. On the contrary: <b>articles mentioning the companies whose shares go
              viral on Reddit tend to display an overall negative tone</b>. While this observation does not allow any
              categorical statements, this may be linked with a feature of meme stock events, highlighted by many
              analysts. <br>A stock’s popularity on social media is usually unrelated to the positive performance of
              the business and of the company's fundamentals. This fact reinforces a common criticism of Wall Street,
              the excessive decoupling of the financial market from the “real economy”.

            <p>
              On the day of maximum social network activity around a specific stock,
              that is when there is a spike in mentions on WSB, <b>on Twitter we found a
              bigger percentage of positive tweets among those mentioning the ticker</b>.<br>
              Only tweets mentioning GME display a prevailing negative
              sentiment on days of mentions’ peak. Gamestop not only recorded the highest traded
              volume in 2021, but also dragged animated debates. Committing users from different
              social media outlets, these discussions agglutinate a heterogenous plethora of voices
              and opinions, which eventually took diverging positions, sometimes extrapolating Wall
              Street and the financial market, flirting with populist tones, when not lapsing into
              hate speech and even antisemitism. Given the exceptional polarisation of discourse
              around GameStop one can possibly understand the amount of negative tweets and the
              lack of a significant difference among positive and negative tweets per day.<br>
              We also analysed tweet sentiment in relation to activity on Reddit. Data suggest a <b>correlation
              between maximum activity on Reddit and the stabilisation of positive tweets’ statistical behaviour</b>.
              Posts who show different tones, after the peak polarise toward a shared, not much variable, sentiment.

              Social media mentions, mainstream media coverage and online discussion polarisation may be responsible for the ‘hype’
              around a stock. But this is not the only factor for a company share to become a meme stock. Gamestop came to be considered
              as a paradigmatic case, but not every stock popular on Reddit displays similar repercussions on volume, price dynamics
              and volatility.<br>
              Although the American financial authority reported that a meme stock is characterised by <i>“the convergence of large price moves,
              large volume changes, large short interest, frequent mentions on social media, and significant coverage in mainstream media”</i>
              (SEC, 2021), the interaction of these factors and their reciprocal significance have not been explored so far.<br> Thus, while dealing
              with such an undefined phenomenon and large amounts of data, we used machine learning unsupervised techniques to look for meaningful
              groups among the stocks selected for this work.<br>In the identification of different groups <b>the most discriminant features confirmed to be related to social media activity
              and interest</b>, to Wall Street Bet and its echo across other platforms such as other subreddits and even Twitter.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0">
            <p>
              Also relevant is the incidence of financial data: the presence of short sales percentage among most relevant variables
              supports the fact that <b>the meme stock phenomenon involves stocks which are often considered bad deals and therefore shorted</b>.<br>
              We tried different algorithms and all resulted in the same cluster division.
              Among the stocks who gained visibility online <b>three separeted groups have been identified</b>: one is composed only by GME and AMC, which are also widely recognized as paradigmatic cases.
              A second group reunites the shares of companies that went viral but hardly ever exceeded
              the anomaly price return threshold that we fixed to be 50% within 10 consecutive days. Most of them are well-known companies
              (Facebook, Tesla, Apple), that have high capitalization and whose productive activities are not in a bad shape as those shorted.
              Finally, a third group (e.g. Ironnet inc., SoFi Technologies, Root Inc) reunites smaller companies with
              lower market capitalization and thus more prone to crowd pumping dynamics. In fact, during 2021, most of them experienced at least
              a period of high volatility on stock price due to social activities.

              We collected a huge amount of daily data. We want to try to answer one last question: <b>are these data relevant enough to build an effective predictive model</b>?
              The alert signal must be triggered as soon as the 50% cumulative price return threshold is expected to be exceeded in the next 10 days. For this purpose, we trained some traditional models (Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, LDA, Linear SVC, Random Forest Classifier) on a training set consisting of the 16 tickers analysed.
              We prefer high precision (that means no wrong investments) rather than high recall. <br>The best performing model resulting after cross validation and hyperparameter tuning on the training set is a Random Forest Classifier.

            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6 pt-4 pt-lg-0">
            <p>
              For the test set, we have selected two other tickers among the most cited ones in WSB: SNDL (Sundial Growers Inc) and
              LCID (Lucid Motors). They both registered anomalous stock price raises during 2021. <br>
              Results aren't great, but still good with an <b>overall 95% accuracy, 100% precision and 6% recall</b>.
              In fact, although the trained model is not able to detect any of the LCID anomalies, we have two matching
              alert for SNDL that would have meant an at least 50% ROI and that span from a "buy" signal on the 26th day
              to a "sell" signal within the 36th day.<br>
              We are missing the real peak, however this is a good start.
